## Machine Learning Progress
1. Creating and Searching Dataset
2. Creating our own model and Improving pretrained model
3. Evaluating the loss and accuracy of the model
4. Deploying the model

## Machine Learning Objective
1. Creating model for mentor recommender system
2. Creating model for video recommender system
3. Creating model for video classification to generate uploaded video's tag
